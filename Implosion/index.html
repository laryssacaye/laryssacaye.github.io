	<h1>What Do I Know?</h1><hr/>
	<p> I know the following questions...<br/>
	   I know where these products can be located, why this product is popular, who the audiance for this device is, also who is excluded in the target audiance, and why a person is drawn to an Amazon Fire Stick. I also am able to share more on the content of the inside of the fire stick. I also know some of who has access to these devices, and some of the history behind this device. I also have found that there have been investigations involving Alexa, and have been multiple lawsuits filed based on the storing of information that is able to happen throught he alexa device.

	<p> A WHOLE LOT. I have done a lot of research, including watching a few 10 year olds crack open the Amazon Fire Stick. However, a lot of information around Alexa and the Amazon Fire stick more importantly are not able to be pin pointed yet. I am really interested in the production of the product as well as the storage of the information. I am trying to still find the answered to many different questions on the list, but am having a much more difficult time then I originally anticipated. <br/>
